# Google-Maps-To-Kakao-Daum-Maps
As a foreigner who has travelled to Korea before I discovered a common issue when requesting taxis and a general lack of GPS information on google maps. When searching a location there was often times an address that was useless to taxi drivers and couldn't be input into the more popular local GPS services hosted by Daum/Kakao. Using the GeoCoding API from google maps and the Kakao Developers Coordinates to Address Translation API I will be able to convert google maps addresses to addresses in Korean usable by taxi drivers and searchable in Kakao maps.
